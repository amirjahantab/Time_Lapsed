# Time_Lapsed Application

This is a simple stopwatch application built using tkinter library in Python.

## Features
- Start: Begins the stopwatch timer.
- Stop: Pauses the stopwatch timer.
- Reset: Resets the stopwatch timer to 00:00:00.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install tkinter`.
3. Run the `stopwatch.py` file using Python.

## How it works
- The stopwatch starts counting the time when the 'Start' button is clicked.
- The 'Stop' button pauses the stopwatch timer.
- The 'Reset' button resets the stopwatch timer to 00:00:00.
- The tkinter `Label` widget is used to display the elapsed time in the format HH:MM:SS.
- The `time` module is used to calculate the elapsed time in seconds.
- The `root.after()` method is used to update the time display every second.
